1) To get into Troll temple, kill the child and give Armband of Sorrow to the Statue of Gleon.

2) To get to Mannyn's place from the Troll side, give Bracelet of Hidingto Gleon (Bracelet obtained from pretty lady in room 2)

3) To get into Elves temple, submit statue, and beckon the child to the statue.

5) To get the last task attack Mannyn, and he will ask you to Learn tosurrender to peace.

6) I found that it you tried to give Mannyn the Bracelet Of Hiding when he isnot attacking, you will get a nosave portal called Temporary Truce.

7) Kill the wounded warrior till you get a elvish body armor

8) Attack Mannyn till Mannyn says, "You are a good fighter, perhaps togetherwe can establish peace in these lands."

This happens sometime in the mid of the fight. So you might have to watch the fight carefully.

9) You give elvish body armor to Mannyn. Mannyn gasps in Astonishment.

Mannyn exclaims, "You have surrendered all that is protecting you!"

Mannyn says, "You are truly an advocate of peace.

Please take this as a symbol to show my sons that peace is the better path."

You receive Permanent Peace from Mannyn.

Note that the fight with Mannyn won't stop until you give him the armor, and that it can take a very long time.
